# Competitive Programming

Algorithms are everywhere, and studying them can give you 'superpowers.' The ability to solve problems efficiently is a highly sought-after skill by companies. This repository contains the code I've been studying to master data structures and algorithms. The programming languages I enjoy the most are Python and C++.

## Graphs
Graphs can be used to model a lot of real-world problems and structures in computer science, mathematics, and various other fields. Understanding graph algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search), Dijkstra, and Kruskal is essential to solve many recurring computer science problems. If you know some of these algorithms, try to think applications of them in PacMan:

## Binary Search
Efficiency is key when running algorithms. A code that runs in O(log n) is much better than one that runs in O(n). Therefore, it's always a good practice to use binary search when you need to quickly find an element in a sorted array or dataset. Think of it this way: when you're looking for a word in a dictionary, how do you approach it? (I think nobody searches for it page by page!)


## Dynamic programming
Think of DP as a way to "remember" previous computations to avoid redundant work. This is especially useful for optimization problems, where you're looking for the best solution under certain constraints.One example of a problem is as follows: How much gold can you collect from a grid while navigating through it? You can start from any position in the first row, but in each step, you can only move down-left, down, or down-right.
